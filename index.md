I'm a PhD student in [Brown CS](https://cs.brown.edu). My thesis advisors are Prof. Stan Zdonik and Prof. Seny Kamara. 

I am interested in the theories and designs of big data systems that are intelligent and safe. I draw on techniques from cryptography, machine learning, and relational databases.

## Updates
- Paper on our project Structurally Encrypted Relational Database accepted at CIDR'21.
- Submitted [An Optimal Relational Database Encryption Scheme](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/274) to eprint. This work uses token trees, an analogous to query trees in relational algebra, to compute end-to-end encrypted relational queries. -- March 2020
