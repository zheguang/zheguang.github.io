I graduated with a PhD from [Brown CS](https://cs.brown.edu). My thesis advisors are Stan Zdonik and Seny Kamara. My committee is George Kollios and Moti Yung.

I am interested in the theories and designs of big data systems that are intelligent and safe. I draw on techniques from cryptography, machine learning, and relational databases.
