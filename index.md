I'm a PhD student in [Brown CS](https://cs.brown.edu).

My sensei are [Stan Zdonik](https://cs.brown.edu/~sbz/), [Seny Kamara](https://cs.brown.edu/~seny/), and [Tarik Moataz](https://cs.brown.edu/~tmoataz/). I also collaborate with Ugur Cetintemel, Carsten Binnig and Tim Kraska in the Database Group, [Emanuel Zgraggen](http://emanuelzgraggen.com/) in the Graphics Group, and Eli Upfal and Lorenzo De Stefani in the Theory Group.

I am interested in the theories and designs of big data systems that are intelligent and safe. My research spans a broad area covering cryptography, data science/machine learning, and big data systems. I'm building encrypted data systems that are provably secure at [Sifr Systems](http://sifrsystems.com) with some [fantastic people](http://sifrsystems.com/#team). We're much more secure than [CryptDB](https://css.csail.mit.edu/cryptdb/).
